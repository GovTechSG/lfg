# Recruiting for your workgroup

Hello! Looking for folks to join your awesome workgroup? Simply write a **short** snippet in the [Startups](/README.md#Startups) section with the following details.

- Name of workgroup and statement of purpose. What impact will participants make by being part of the workgroup? What will they be doing?
- Who're you looking for? SWEs? UXDs? Folks with specific experience in certain tools?
- How to find you? The most important part. Leave your Slack or Telegram or Discord channel, or e-mail address, or some way to join the group's discussion.
